This is my undergraduate research project: to develop a bed-based toolset to monitor a disabled child’s health and activity during the night. My role in this project is to design an anutomate system using thermal sensing methods (theromocouple and digital temperature sensor) for enuresis detection. Sleep quality in children with severe disabilities is correlated to their daytime wellness and ability to learn. Enuresis, or bed wetting, can significantly affect sleep quality. Such an automated system would eliminate the need to conduct manual bed checks several times during the night for each child.
