This is an individual class project to explore the effects of water bolus for hyperthermia heating pattern. "Hyperthermia System delivers localized therapeutic heating (hyperthermia) to solid tumors by applying radiofrequency (RF) energy. A water bolus used in superficial hyperthermia couples the electromagnetic (EM) or acoustic energy into the target tissue and cools the tissue surface to minimize thermal hotspots and patient discomfort during treatment". In this project, COMSOL Multiphysics was used to build the neck and hyperthermia model, and to simulate heating patterns of different water bolus shapes and different antenna configurations.
 

## Workflow

1. Model setup:

2. Antenna design and reflection characteristic simulation.

3. Heating pattern simulation using COMSOL:

4. Literature comparision.
Although the preliminery results are not very consistent and a more robust model is needed, the experiments indicate that the thickness and the shape of water bolus is effective in changing heating pattern of hyperthermia. Utlizing the attena design and water bolus can improve radiation targeting effectively and reduce radiation on necessary areas.
