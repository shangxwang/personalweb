This is an individual class project for building a wearable device that measures electrocardiogram (ECG). The project integrates circuit-level design concepts with medical instrumentation. In this project, I worked on circuit design and simulation using PSpice, implementating the circuit on breadbroad, designing PCB circuit board layout using EAGLE, and populating Voltera printed circuit boards. The device that I built was able to acquire decent ECG signals. 

## Workflow

**1. Circuit simulation (AD620-based circuit):**

**2. Breadbroad implementation.**

**3. PCB layout using EAGLE: **
