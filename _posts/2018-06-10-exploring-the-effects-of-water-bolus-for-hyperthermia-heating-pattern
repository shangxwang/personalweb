This is an individual class project to explore the effects of water bolus for hyperthermia heating pattern. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to build the neck and hyperthermia model, and to simulate heating patterns of different water bolus shapes and different antenna configurations.
 

## Workflow

1. Model setup:

2. Antenna design and reflection characteristic simulation.

3. Heating pattern simulation using COMSOL:
