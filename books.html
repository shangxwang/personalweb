<b>歩いても 歩いても /步履不停 /Still Walking</b>
<br>
<br> I am a fan of Chinese and Japanese books (translated into Chinese). This is a book by Hirokazu Koreeda that I really like. I also recomend the movie. I read it in the translated Chinese version since I don't really know Japanese. Very touching book and movie about family relationship.

<b>ラヴレター /情书 /Love Letter</b>
<br>
<br> This is a book and a movie by Shunji Iwai. I read the book and watched the movie several times and it's been one of my favorite. A warm, simple, and beautiful story, and a little bit sad.

<b>城南旧事 /My Memories of Old Beijing</b>
<br>
<br> This is a book by Lin Haiyin and I love the way she narrates the stories. It is about memories growing up, the innocent joy of childhood, and the bittersweetness of growing up. Classic and one of my favorite.
